# Foci Lock Down App

This is a repo for our Applet on Android. It will lock your android phone until a particular assignment is completed or returned. Uses flutter, the google classroom api among other things. 
## Common Errors

1) "Target of URl doesn't exist 'package:flutter/material.dart'
Go to your console and type in ```flutter pub get```

## Future goals
1) Make it friendly for other aspect ratios
2) Make the "locking down" better than just employing kiosk mode (when the original was implemented, we didn't have the permissions)

## Link to APK

For some reason getting this as a release seems impossible. Below is a google drive link to an APK of this app.
